## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

### ✅ Cucumber (Gherkin + Python)
- Experienced in behavior-driven development (BDD) using **Cucumber** with **Gherkin** language.
- Proficient in writing **feature files** and step definitions in **Python** using `Behave` or `pytest-bdd`.
- Capable of integrating cucumber tests into CI/CD pipelines for automated regression testing.
- Strong focus on creating readable, maintainable, and reusable test scenarios.

### ✅ Cypress
- Advanced skills in **end-to-end testing** using **Cypress.io**.
- Developed robust UI test suites with automatic waiting, time travel, and debugging capabilities.
- Experience handling fixtures, intercepting HTTP requests, custom commands, and managing complex user flows.
- Integrated Cypress with GitHub Actions and Docker for scalable testing environments.

### ✅ JMeter
- Proven expertise in performance and load testing using **Apache JMeter**.
- Created and executed **functional tests**, load tests, stress tests, and spike tests.
- Analyzed results through response times, throughput, assertions, and graphs.
- Configured distributed testing for large-scale scenarios.

### ✅ k6 (Performance Testing)
- Hands-on experience with **k6**, a developer-centric performance testing tool.
- Wrote JavaScript-based test scripts to simulate traffic and measure system behavior under load.
- Monitored and analyzed metrics like **HTTP request rate, response time, latency, and error rates**.
- Integrated k6 with CI/CD tools and cloud platforms for advanced reporting and scalability.

### ✅ Selenium
- Solid background using **Selenium WebDriver** with **Python** for browser automation.
- Designed page object models (POM) for modular and scalable test frameworks.
- Executed cross-browser testing across different operating systems and mobile emulators.
- Automated complex web interactions such as file uploads, pop-ups, drag-and-drop, and dynamic content.

## 📄 Test Documentation & Templates

I am skilled at creating and maintaining high-quality testing documentation, including:

### 🗂️ Bug Report Template
- Includes: Title, Description, Steps to Reproduce, Expected vs Actual Result, Severity, Priority, Environment, Attachments.
- Follows IEEE 829 standards and bug tracking systems like Jira, Trello, or GitHub Issues.

### 🔁 Bug Lifecycle
- Clear understanding of the full lifecycle of bugs from discovery to resolution:
  - New → Assigned → Open → Fixed → Retest → Verified/Closed or Reopened.
  
### 🔍 Traceability Matrix (RTM)
- Maintained Requirement Traceability Matrices to ensure all requirements are covered by test cases.
- Helped ensure complete test coverage and compliance with project scope.

### 🧾 Test Case Template
- Structured test case design with fields: ID, Title, Description, Precondition, Steps, Expected Result, Actual Result, Status, Notes.

### 📝 Test Plan Template
- Defined objectives, scope, test approach, resources, risks, deliverables, and schedule.
- Included entry/exit criteria, suspension/resumption conditions.

### 📤 GitHub Issue Reporting
- Used GitHub issues effectively to track bugs, enhancements, and tasks.
- Applied labels, milestones, assignees, and projects for better management.

### 📊 Software Test Execution Report
- Generated detailed reports showing test execution status, pass/fail ratio, defect analysis, environment details, and recommendations.
